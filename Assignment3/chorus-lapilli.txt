First, we copypaste our tic-tac-toe code into our new App.js as a baseline for chorus-lapilli. Our first course of action should be  to limit each player's 
maximum pieces to 3. So we have a global variable that checks if it's turn 6. If the turn is greater than or less than 6 we put a return statement to 
temporarily stop the player from making any more moves. To actually make sure that the user is limited to 3 moves, we have an empty array. Depending on whether
it is X's or O's next move, we update two arrays containing the positions of the X's and O's. Now when it hits turn 6 or above, we will shift() away the first 
element and push in the new array position at the end of the array and update our board respectively. 

To implement the adjacent moving, we make a function called checkValidMove() that takes in the particular player's turn and the destination where the player
wants to move. I then hard-coded every switch scenario that the player could move to depending on where their initial positions are. 

I also implemented the part of the code that the middle square must be vacated if the player did not win the game or vacate the center square. The code will
simply return INVALID MOVE in the console in that scenario.
