1. Where are the sh, sleep, and type commands located?
In the /usr/bin directory

2. What executable programs in /usr/bin have names that are exactly three characters long and start with the two letters se, and what do they do?
sed OPTIONS... [SCRIPTS] [INPUT]: stream editor edits text from an input based on given parameters
set [OPTION] [ARGUMENTS]: sets or unsets a flag using OPTIONS with ARGUMENTS as parameter for position
seq [OPTION] LAST/seq [OPTION] FIRST LAST/seq [OPTION] FIRST INC LAST: prints out a sequence of numbers

3. When you execute the command named by the symbolic link /usr/local/cs/bin/emacs, which file actually is executed?
The GNU Emacs manual file shows up, or the emacs-26.1 file

4. What is the version number of the /usr/bin/gcc program? of the plain gcc program? Why are they different programs?
For plain gcc, the version is 8.5.0 (we find this out by doing gcc -v). For the /usr/bin/gcc program we get 4.8.5 (we do this by doing /usr/bin/gcc -v).
They're different executables as seen when you change your path.

5. The chmod program changes permissions on a file. What does the symbolic mode u+sx,o-w mean, in terms of permissions?
u + sx: lets your file be executable for you and the "s" allows you to set user ID
o - w: removed writing permissions from the user.

6. Use the find command to find all directories modified on or after the day of this classâ€™s first lecture, that are located under (or are the same as) 
the directory /usr/local/cs. If there are more than ten such directories, sort the directory names alphabetically and just just the first ten names.
Use command find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -12, find under the desired directory (/usr/local/cs) -type d represents type directory and -mtime -12 means
within the last 12 days.
/usr/local/cs/bin

7. Of the files in the same directory as find, how many of them are symbolic links?
First cd into find and then do find /usr/bin/ -type l to find all the symbolic links, add | wc to find the number. 285 symbolic links.

8. What is the oldest file in the /usr/lib64 directory? Use the last-modified time to determine age. Specify the name of the file without the /usr/lib64/ prefix. 
Don't ignore files whose names start with ".", but do ignore files under subdirectories of /usr/lib64/. Consider files of all types, that is, 
your answer might be a regular file, or a directory, or something else.
run ls -lt | tail -1
librom1394.so.0.3.0

9. In Emacs, what commands have transpose in their name?
C-t transposes 2 characters
M-t transposes 2 words
C-M-t transposes 2 balanced expressions
C-x C-t transposes 2 lines
M-x transpose-sentences transposes 2 sentences
M-x transpose-paragraphs transposes 2 paragraphs
M-x transpose-regions transposes 2 regions

10. What does the Emacs yank function do, and how can you easily invoke it using keystrokes?
C-y is the yank function, it takes the most recently killed text (do C-k to kill rest of line past cursor) and pastes it to where your cursor currently is.
It takes back KILLED text, not deleted

11. When looking at the directory /usr/bin, what's the difference between the output of the ls -l command, and the directory listing of the Emacs dired command?
Some files are missing in Emacs' dired command, for example rapper is missing.

12. Use the ps command to find your own login shell's process, all that process's ancestors, and all its descendants. 
Some ps options that you might find useful include -e, -f, -j, -l, -t, -H, and -T.
There's only bash running right now. Bash's parent is systemd and it's descendant is emacs which also has {emacs} descended off of it.
So basic diagram: systemd - bash - emacs - {emacs}
